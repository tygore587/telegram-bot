# What is it?
This is my personal telegram bot to make my life easier.

# Features
## Youtube to pocket cast podcast
I always have the problem that I want to here a youtube video as a podcast. To make this happen, I need to:
1. Download the video with yt-dlp
2. Convert it to mp3 via ffmpeg
3. Upload it to pocketcast

The next thing is, that I need to stay infront of the computer all the time and I can't do this while I'm somewhere else.

The goal is to automate all the steps. So I only need to download the mp3 on my pocket cast app at the end.
